    description: `Was there a beginning of time? Could time run backwards? 
    Is the universe infinite or does it have boundaries? 
    These are just some of the questions considered in an internationally acclaimed masterpiece by one of the world's greatest thinkers. 
    It begins by reviewing the great theories of the cosmos from Newton to Einstein, before delving into the secrets which still lie at the heart of space and time, from the Big Bang to black holes, via spiral galaxies and strong theory.`,

    title: "After dark",
    author: "Haruki Murakami",
    cover: "/book-covers/haruki-murakami-after-dark.jpg",
    description: `The midnight hour approaches in an almost empty all-night diner. Mari sips her coffee and glances up from a book as a young man, a musician, intrudes on her solitude. Both have missed the last train home.
    Later, Mari is interrupted again by a girl from the Alphaville Hotel; a Chinese prostitute has been hurt by a client, and she needs Mari's help.
    Meanwhile Mari's beautiful sister Eri sleeps a deep, heavy sleep that is 'to perfect, too pure' to be normal; she has lain asleep for two months. But tonight a the digital clock displays 00:00, a hint of life flickers across the TV screen, though the television's plug has been pulled out.
    Strange nocturnal happenings, or a trick of the night?`,

    title: "The Ocean at the End of the Lane",
    author: "Neil Gaiman",
    cover: "/book-covers/ocean-by-the-end-of-the-lane.jpeg",
    description: `A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. 
    Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. 
    He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back.
    And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.`,

    author: "Роман Злотников",
    cover: "/book-covers/roman-zlotnikov-vivat-imperator.jpeg",
    description: `В конце девяностых на политической арене России появляется молодой и амбициозный персонаж: Дмитрий Ярославичев, глава «Фонда Рюрика» и, по слухам, прямой наследник рода Романовых. 
    Его организация обладает неиссякаемыми финансовыми ресурсами, которые совершенно бескорыстно идут на развитие страны. 
    Власти в замешательстве – что заставляет Ярославичева разбрасываться деньгами, откуда у юного главы фонда такое состояние? 
    Неужели все, что он делает для соотечественников, можно объяснить мифической щедростью?..`,
